### Welcome to InterMine! ðŸ‘‹

Before diving into details on the BlueGenes user interface and its capabilities, let us introduce some background information about the InterMine software. 

### Disparate data in, unified data out

InterMine is a data warehouse system that integrates biological data sources, making it easy to query and analyse data. It is an [open-source](https://github.com/intermine/intermine) project that is available for use under the open-source [LGPL](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl.html) license. InterMine was developed by the [Micklem lab](http://www.micklemlab.org/) at the [University of Cambridge](https://www.gen.cam.ac.uk/) with the [Wellcome Trust](https://wellcome.org/)'s support; complementary projects have been funded by the[ National Human Genome Research Institute \(NIH/NHGRI\)](https://www.nih.gov/) and the [Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council \(BBSRC\)](https://bbsrc.ukri.org/). InterMine includes an attractive, user-friendly interface, known as BlueGenes, that works â€˜**out of the box**â€™ and can be easily customised for your specific needs, as well as a powerful, scriptable web-service API to allow programmatic access to your data.

### There's an InterMine for \(almost\) anyone!

There are many different InterMines worldwide, covering a broad range of model organisms and life science research areas, including:

* [FlyMine](https://www.flymine.org/)  - a data warehouse of integrated fruit fly genetic, genomic and proteomic data
* [HumanMine](https://www.humanmine.org/) - an integrated database of Homo sapiens genomic data
* [MouseMine](http://www.mousemine.org/) - an integrated data warehouse of mouse genomic data, developed by MGI
* [YeastMine](https://yeastmine.yeastgenome.org/) - an integrated data warehouse of yeast genomic data, developed by SGD
* [ZebrafishMine](http://zebrafishmine.org/) - an integrated data warehouse of zebrafish genomic data, developed by ZFIN
* [RatMine](http://ratmine.mcw.edu/ratmine/begin.do) - an integrated data warehouse of rat genomic data, developed by RGD
* [TargetMine](http://targetmine.mizuguchilab.org/) - a data warehouse for candidate gene prioritisation and drug target discovery, developed at NIBIO, Japan.
* [ThaleMine](https://apps.araport.org/thalemine) - a data warehouse for Arabidopsis thaliana Col-0 for the ARAPORT project
* [PhytoMine](https://phytozome.jgi.doe.gov/phytomine) - an integrated data warehouse of over 50 plant genomes from Phytozome.

### InterMine features

Benefiting from over a decade of data warehousing experience and input from a wide range of research collaborators, InterMine is still in active development and is used by many major model organism databases, among others. InterMine features include:

* Sophisticated data integration facilities
* Fast, flexible querying across several data sources at once
* User-friendly web interface and analysis tools
* An extensive set of APIs and web tools
* Highly developed and extensible system
* One platform to many organisms and data types without visiting several sites
